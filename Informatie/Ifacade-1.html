Implement this interface to connect your code to the graphical user interface
(GUI).

<ul>
<li>For separating the code that you wrote from the code that was provided to
you, put <b>ALL your code in the <code>src</code> folder.</b> The code that
is provided to you stays in the <code>src-provided</code> folder. Only if you
modify the provided code, it's advised to move the modified code to the
<code>src</code> folder, so that your changes cannot be accidentally
overwritten by an updated version of the provided code.</li>

<li>You should at least <b>create the following classes</b> in the package
<code>asteroids.model</code>:
<ul>
<li>a class <code>Ship</code> for representing a space ship</li>
</ul>
You may, of course, add additional classes as you see fit.

<li>You should <b>create a class <code>Facade</code></b> that implements this
interface. This class should be placed <b>in the package
<code>asteroids.facade</code></b>.</li>

<li>The <b>header of that Facade class</b> should look as follows:<br>
<code>class Facade implements IFacade { ... }</code><br>
Consult the <a href=
"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/createinterface.html">
Java tutorial</a> for more information on interfaces, if necessary.</li>
 
<li>Your <code>Facade</code> class should offer a <b>default constructor</b>.
</li>

<li><b>Each method</b> defined in the interface <code>IFacade</code> must be
implemented by the class <code>Facade</code>. For example, the implementation
of {@link #getShipRadius(Ship) } should call one or more methods on the given
ship to retrieve its current radius.</li>

<li>Methods in this interface are <b>only allowed to throw exceptions of type
<code>asteroids.util.ModelException</code></b> (this class is provided). No
other exception types are allowed. This exception can only be thrown if (1)
calling a method of your <code>Ship</code> class with the given parameters
would violate a precondition, or (2) if the method of your <code>Ship</code>
class throws an exception (if so, wrap the exception in a
<code>ModelException</code>).</li>

<li><b>ModelException should not be used anywhere outside of your Facade
implementation.</b></li>

<li>Your Facade implementation should <b>only contain trivial code</b> (for
example, calling a method, combining multiple return values into an array,
creating @Value instances, catching exceptions and wrapping it in a
ModelException). All non-trivial code should be placed in the other classes
that you create.</li>

<li>The rules described above and the documentation described below for each
method apply only to the class implementing IFacade. <b>Your Ship class
should follow the rules described in the assignment.</b></li>

<li><b>Do not modify the signatures</b> of the methods defined in this
interface.</li>

</ul>
