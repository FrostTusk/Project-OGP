 Implement this interface to connect your code to the graphical user interface
 (GUI).

 <ul>
 <li>For separating the code that you wrote from the code that was provided to
 you, put <b>ALL your code in the <code>src</code> folder.</b> The code that
 is provided to you stays in the <code>src-provided</code> folder. Only if you
 modify the provided code, it's advised to move the modified code to the
 <code>src</code> folder, so that your changes cannot be accidentally
 overwritten by an updated version of the provided code.</li>

 <li>You should at least <b>create the following classes</b> in the package
 <code>asteroids.model</code>:
 <ul>
 <li>a class <code>Ship</code> for representing a space ship</li>
 <li>a class <code>World</code> for representing a world</li>
 <li>a class <code>Bullet</code> for representing a bullet</li>
 <li>a class <code>Asteroid</code> for representing an asteroid</li>
 <li>a class <code>Planetoid</code> for representing a planetoid</li>
 <li>a class <code>Program</code> for representing an executable program</li>
 </ul>
 You may, of course, add additional classes as you see fit.

 <li>You should <b>change your <code>Facade</code></b> from part 2 to
 implement this interface.</li>

 <li>The <b>header of that Facade class</b> should look as follows:<br>
 <code>class Facade implements asteroids.part3.facade.IFacade { ... }</code><br>
 Consult the <a href=
 "http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/createinterface.html">
 Java tutorial</a> for more information on interfaces, if necessary.</li>
 *
 <li>Your <code>Facade</code> class should offer a <b>default constructor</b>.
 </li>

 <li><b>Each non-deprecated method</b> defined in this {@link IFacade}
 interface and the interfaces from part 1 (
 {@link asteroids.part1.facade.IFacade}) and part 2
 ({@link asteroids.part2.facade.IFacade}) must be implemented by your Facade
 class.

 <li>The methods {@link #createShip()},
 {@link #createShip(double, double, double, double, double, double)},
 {@link #move(Ship, double)} and {@link #thrust(Ship, double)} from part 1 are
 <b>deprecated</b> and no longer need to be implemented.</li>

 <li>Methods in this interface are <b>only allowed to throw exceptions of type
 <code>asteroids.util.ModelException</code></b> (this class is provided). No
 other exception types are allowed. This exception can only be thrown if (1)
 calling the method with the given parameters would violate a precondition, or
 (2) if the method causes an exception to be thrown in your code (if so, wrap
 the exception in a <code>ModelException</code>).</li>

 <li><b>ModelException should not be used anywhere outside of your Facade
 implementation.</b></li>

 <li>Your Facade implementation should <b>only contain trivial code</b> (for
 example, calling a method, combining multiple return values into an array,
 creating @Value instances, catching exceptions and wrapping it in a
 ModelException). All non-trivial code should be placed in the other classes
 that you create.</li>

 <li>The rules described above and the documentation described below for each
 method apply only to the class implementing IFacade. <b>Your other classes
 should follow the rules described in the assignment.</b></li>

 <li><b>Do not modify the signatures</b> of the methods defined in this
 interface.</li>

 </ul>
