 A program factory is used by the parser ({@link ProgramParser}) to construct
 an in-memory representation of your program. For example, when reading the
 program source code

 <pre>
 print getx self
 </pre>

 the parser will create a Program object by (conceptually) executing the
 following code:

 <pre>
 factory.createProgram(Collections.emptyList(),
 		factory.createPrintStatement(factory.createGetXExpression(factory.createSelfExpression())));
 </pre>

 on the returned factory object.

 <p>
 For testing, you may use the methods from {@link ProgramParser} yourself, as
 demonstrated in the test file {@link Part3TestFull}.

 <p>
 You should declare your class as follows:<code><pre>
 public class ProgramFactory implements IProgramFactory&lt;MyExpression, MyStatement, MyFunction, Program&gt;
 </pre></code> where MyExpression, MyStatement and MyFunction are your classes
 for representing expressions, statements and function definitions,
 respectively.

 <p>
 The SourceLocation object in the methods defined by this factory refers to
 the location (line and column) in the text file where the statement or
 expression begins.

<ul>
 <li>@param <!--<E>-->
            Your class for representing an expression.</li>
 <li>@param <!--<S>-->
            Your class for representing a statement.</li>
 <li>@param <!--<F>-->
            Your class representing function definitions.</li>
 <li>@param <!--<P>-->
            Your class for representing a program (should be Program).</li>
</ul>
