How to reproduce:	
Attempts:	randomly
Technique:	place breakpoint at world.java => #Bug-1#,
		debug part2, let ship collide with boundaries until
		breakpoint is triggered.


What we Know:
entity = the entity that's f-ed up.
this = the world the entity is in
	1. entity.isInWorld(this) => false
	2. entity is in getAllEntitiesList()
	3. entity is not in updatedEntities
	4. updatedEntities is empty => last call was update?
	5. the velocity where he collides is not changed.	


Possible Theories:
1. Problem with rounding: due to the randomness of the bug, this seems somewhat likely.
2. getFirstCollision() did not predict correctly. Or the getFirstCollisionTime() is incorrect.
