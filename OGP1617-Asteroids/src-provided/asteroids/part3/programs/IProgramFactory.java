/**
 * A program factory is used by the parser ({@link ProgramParser}) to construct
 * an in-memory representation of your program. For example, when reading the
 * program source code
 * 
 * <pre>
 * print getx self
 * </pre>
 * 
 * the parser will create a Program object by (conceptually) executing the
 * following code:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * factory.createProgram(Collections.emptyList(),
 * 		factory.createPrintStatement(factory.createGetXExpression(factory.createSelfExpression())));
 * </pre>
 * 
 * on the returned factory object.
 * 
 * <p>
 * For testing, you may use the methods from {@link ProgramParser} yourself, as
 * demonstrated in the test file {@link Part3TestFull}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * You should declare your class as follows:<code><pre>
 * public class ProgramFactory implements IProgramFactory&lt;MyExpression, MyStatement, MyFunction, Program&gt;
 * </pre></code> where MyExpression, MyStatement and MyFunction are your classes
 * for representing expressions, statements and function definitions,
 * respectively.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The SourceLocation object in the methods defined by this factory refers to
 * the location (line and column) in the text file where the statement or
 * expression begins.
 * 
 * @param <E>
 *            Your class for representing an expression.
 * @param <S>
 *            Your class for representing a statement.
 * @param <F>
 *            Your class representing function definitions.
 * @param <P>
 *            Your class for representing a program (should be Program).
